# Integration Test: Images with Spaces in Filenames

This document tests various ways of referencing images with spaces in their filenames.

## Markdown Image Syntax

Regular markdown image with spaces (unencoded):
![Test Image](./images/test image with spaces.png)

URL-encoded markdown image:
![Test Image Encoded](./images/test%20image%20with%20spaces.png)

## Wikilink Syntax

Wikilink image with spaces:
![](./images/test%20image%20with%20spaces.png)

Wikilink image with URL encoding:
![](./images/test%20image%20with%20spaces.png)

## HTML Image Tags

HTML img tag with spaces:
<img src="./images/test image with spaces.png" alt="Test Image HTML">

HTML img tag with URL encoding:
<img src="./images/test%20image%20with%20spaces.png" alt="Test Image HTML Encoded">

## Links to Images

Regular link to image with spaces:
[Download Image](./images/test image with spaces.png)

URL-encoded link to image:
[Download Image Encoded](./images/test%20image%20with%20spaces.png)

## Wikilink to Image as Asset

Wikilink reference to image as asset:
[images/test image with spaces.png](images/test%20image%20with%20spaces.png)

This file should test all the space-handling functionality across:
- Assets emitter (finding and copying the image)
- Wikilink transformer (converting [[]] syntax)  
- Stale links transformer (updating links appropriately)
